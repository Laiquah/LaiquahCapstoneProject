                  <p class="question">
                    Question: What are the different types of electricity generators?
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  Answer: There are several types of generators, including AC Generators (Alternators): Generate alternating current (AC) electricity, DC Generators: Generate direct current (DC) electricity, Synchronous Generators: Produce AC electricity synchronized with the grid frequency and Asynchronous Generators (Induction Generators): Often used in wind turbines and some hydroelectric systems.

                  <br>
                  Answer: There are several types of inverters, including Square Wave Inverters: Produce a basic square waveform; not commonly used due to compatibility issues, Modified Sine Wave Inverters: Produce a waveform that approximates a sine wave; suitable for many devices but not all, Pure Sine Wave Inverters: Generate a clean and smooth sine waveform, compatible with almost all devices, Grid-Tie Inverters: Convert DC power from solar panels into AC power for use in homes and feed excess power back into the grid and Microinverters: Used in solar panel installations to convert DC power from individual panels into AC power right at the panel.

                    Question: Do solar panels work during cloudy days or at night?
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  Answer: Solar panels do generate some electricity on cloudy days, although at a reduced efficiency compared to sunny days. They do not generate power at night since they require sunlight to produce electricity.

                  <br>
                  Answer: Yes, gas stoves can be used during power outages because they don't rely on electricity for cooking. However, if your stove has an electric ignition system, you might need to manually light the burners.
